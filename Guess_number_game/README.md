###Description
This is a simple guess the number game, in which we try to guess a computer-generated number in the minimum number of attempts

###Case
Write a code that guesses the number in as few goes as possible
* Computer selects a random number, which we have to guess, meaning write a programme to guess it
* The algorithm takes into account if the number is bigger or smaller that the one we need
* The results are estimated as an average over 1000 cycles
